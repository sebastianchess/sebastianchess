### Fun Fact
I'm a christian programmer, yeah, I know, it's uncommon, but for those who don't believe in my God, here is a brief representation of it. 
```py
from typing import Literal
class Father:
    """The First Person of the Trinity"""
    @staticmethod
    def is_God() -> Literal[True]:
        """Always True"""
        return True


class Son(Father):
    """Second Person of the Trinity (Jesus Christ)"""
    ...


class HolySpirit(Father):
    """Third Person of the Trinity (Holy Spirit)"""
    ...
```
